[entity-description]
	boat=Small and fast boat with small inventory space. Can be placed either on water ways or as an independent vehicle. Enter and leave the boat with SHIFT+ENTER.
	indep-boat=Small and fast boat with small inventory space. Can be placed either on water ways or as an independent vehicle. Enter and leave the boat with SHIFT+ENTER.
	cargo_ship=Large cargo ship able to transport vast amount of resources. Enter and leave the ship with SHIFT+ENTER.
	oil_tanker=Large tanker ship able to transport vast amount of fluids. Enter and leave the ship with SHIFT+ENTER.
	ship_pump=Special pump for loading and unloading tank ships. Can be placed on water. Doesn't collide with ships and needs to placed close to the water ways (this behaviour changed in the 0.0.45 update, pumps must now be placed closer to water rails than before, and will need to be replaced on existing setups)
	oil_rig=Massive swimming extraction platform for deep sea oil. Includes its own local power generation and electric network, supplying the oil rig itself as well as connected ship loading pumps with energy.
	deep_oil=Large deposit of deep sea oil. Extractable with an oil rig.
	port=Destinations for automated ships.
	buoy=Divides the water way system into blocks, allowing multiple ships to run on the same network.
	chain_buoy=Reads the next signals in the path to allow better control of ships.
	bridge_north_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_east_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_south_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_west_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_base=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Place along an existing straight stretch of waterway. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.

[mod-setting-description]
	fuel_modifier=Ships standard fuel capacity is multiplied by this value. Default Value 2.
	waterway_reach_increase=Increase of the players reach while holding waterways, buoys, ports, etc. Allows to place and deconstruct waterways from far away.  Set to '0' in order to disable the reach increase.
	no_oil_for_oil_rig=Makes the technology needed for building deep sea oil rigs not depend on chemical science. Needs to be enabled in order to progress in the game when playing without land-based oil.
	use_dark_blue_waterways=Changes waterways to be darker and thus more visible.
	speed_modifier=Multiply ships' and boats' movement speed by this value. Warning: Fast ships look silly.
